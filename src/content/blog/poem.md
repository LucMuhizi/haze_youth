Life is a fountain of youth;

Not quite everlasting;

So don’t waste your life;

Live it to the fullest;

But don’t throw it all away.

 

Life is what you make it;

Know who you are;

Your values and vices;

Your strengths and weaknesses;

Your truth and story;

Don’t try to fit in but add to.

 

Life is a dance;

The music will eventually stop;

So don’t speed through it;

Enjoy every moment;

Even the missteps.

 

Life is a lesson;

Mistakes experienced;

Fake friends made;

Wrong turns taken;

When we almost break,

But we keep learning. 

We have to not only believe but know that we have that spark in us. Let us use that to IGNITE an impact

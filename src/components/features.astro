    HAZE Music for Youth Empowerment (HAZE Youth) is a non-profit organisation established to enable young people aged 15-35 years to drive change. We challenge the dominant narrative and stereotypes about youth. At the same time, we encourage young people to think different,
     to embrace bold creativity and change, to strive for excellence and to continually learn.
